# Upgrade steps from 7.1 to 7.2

## MySQL/MariaDB database tables character set change

The character set for MySQL/MariaDB database tables is changed from `utf8` to `utf8mb4` to support 4-byte characters. See `data/update/mysql/dbupdate-7.1.0-to-7.2.0.sql` for the SQL upgrade statements.

Beware that these upgrade statements may fail due to index collisions. This is because the indexes have been shortened, so duplicates may occur. If that happens, you must remove the duplicates manually, and then repeat the statements that failed.

You should also change the character set that is specified in the application config, and in legacy if you use that.

In `app/config/config.yml`, set the following:
```yml
doctrine:
    dbal:
        connections:
            default:
                charset: utf8mb4
```
Also make the corresponding change in `app/config/dfs/dfs.yml`.

For legacy, in `ezpublish_legacy/settings/i18n.ini`, set the following:
```
[CharacterSettings]
Charset=utf8mb4
HTTPCharset=utf-8
```
