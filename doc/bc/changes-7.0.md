# Backwards compatibility changes

Changes affecting version compatibility with former or future versions.

## Changes

* Requirements for PHP has been increased to PHP 7.x as it is by now supported by all platforms,
  and provide substantial improved experience developing and working  with PHP compared to PHP 5.

* Requirement for Symfony has been lifted to 3.2, and will be further lifted to 3.4LTS once that is out and all our own
  thrirdpart libraries are known to work correctly with it.

## Deprecations

_7.0 is a major version, hence does not introduce deprecations but rather removes some previously deprecated features,
and in some cases changes features._
