* Clean Installer (`EzSystems\PlatformInstallerBundle\Installer\CleanInstaller`), its service
  definition (`ezplatform.installer.clean_installer`), and the
  `ezplatform.installer.clean_installer.class` parameter have been dropped. Instead use
  the `EzSystems\DoctrineSchema\API\Event\SchemaBuilderEvents::BUILD_SCHEMA` event
  with an event subscriber, and if needed, additionally with the Core Installer
  (`EzSystems\PlatformInstallerBundle\Installer\CoreInstaller`).
  See eZ Platform Documentation for more details.

* The `ezplatform.installer.db_based_installer.class` and `ezplatform.installer.install_command.class`
  parameters have been dropped. The `ezplatform.installer.db_based_installer` service definition has
  been dropped as well. Instead, the FQCN-named service
  `EzSystems\PlatformInstallerBundle\Installer\DbBasedInstaller` is available.

* The `EzSystems\PlatformInstallerBundle\Command\InstallPlatformCommand` has been marked as final.
  Overriding it was never supported. Use the SchemaBuilder event-oriented extension point to inject
  custom behavior into the installation process (see eZ Platform Documentation for more details).

* The deprecated Legacy SQL schema files (`data/mysql/schema.sql`, `data/mysql/dfs_schema.sql`)
  have been removed. Use Schema Builder instead.

* The obsolete `data/demo_data.php` file has been removed.

* The following deprecated (since v6.11) LegacyStorage Gateways were removed:
    - `eZ\Publish\Core\FieldType\BinaryFile\BinaryBaseStorage\Gateway\LegacyStorage`,
    - `eZ\Publish\Core\FieldType\BinaryFile\BinaryFileStorage\Gateway\LegacyStorage`,
    - `eZ\Publish\Core\FieldType\MapLocation\MapLocationStorage\Gateway\LegacyStorage`,
    - `eZ\Publish\Core\FieldType\Image\ImageStorage\Gateway\LegacyStorage`,
    - `eZ\Publish\Core\FieldType\Keyword\KeywordStorage\Gateway\LegacyStorage`,
    - `eZ\Publish\Core\FieldType\Media\MediaStorage\Gateway\LegacyStorage`,
    - `eZ\Publish\Core\FieldType\Url\UrlStorage\Gateway\LegacyStorage`,
    - `eZ\Publish\Core\FieldType\User\UserStorage\Gateway\LegacyStorage`.

  Use `DoctrineStorage` Gateways from the same namespace instead.

* Query Types: Traversing bundles to automatically register a Query Type by the naming
  convention `<Bundle>\QueryType\*QueryType` has been dropped.
  Register your Query Type as a service and explicitly tag that service with `ezpublish.query`
  or enable its automatic configuration (`autoconfigure: true`).

* The deprecated Symfony Dependency Injection Container parameters ending with `.class` have been
  removed, services relying on them have now their classes defined explicitly.
  To properly decorate a Symfony service, use the `decorates` attribute instead.
  For the full list of the dropped parameters please see the
  [8.0/dropped-container-parameters.md](8.0/dropped-container-parameters.md) document.

## Deprecated features

* Using SiteAccess-aware `pagelayout` setting is derecated, use `page_layout` instead.
* View parameter `pagelayout` set by `pagelayout` setting is deprecated, use `page_layout` instead in your Twig templates.


## Renamed features

* `ezpublish` global twig variable was renamed to `ezplatform`
* `ez_is_field_empty` twig function  was renamed to `ez_field_is_empty`
* `ez_first_filled_image_field_identifier` twig function  was renamed to `ez_content_field_identifier_first_filled_image`
* `ez_render_fielddefinition_settings` twig function  was renamed to `ez_render_field_definition_settings`
* `ez_image_asset_content_field_identifier` twig function  was renamed to `ez_content_field_identifier_image_asset`
* `richtext_to_html5` twig filter  was renamed to `ez_richtext_to_html5`

* `ezpublish.core.io.metadata_handler.factory` service was renamed to `ezpublish.core.io.metadata_handler.registry`
* `ezpublish.core.io.binarydata_handler.factory` service was renamed to `ezpublish.core.io.binarydata_handler.registry`

## Changed features

* The signature of the `\eZ\Publish\API\Repository\SearchService::supports` method was changed to:
  ```php
  public function supports(int $capabilityFlag): bool;
  ```
* The signature of the `\eZ\Publish\SPI\Search\Capable::supports` method was changed to:
  ```php
  public function supports(int $capabilityFlag): bool;
  ```
* The signature of the `\eZ\Publish\API\Repository\Values\ValueObject\SiteAccess::__construct` method was changed to make `name` property required:
  ```php
  public function __construct(
      string $name,
      string $matchingType = self::DEFAULT_MATCHING_TYPE,
      $matcher = null,
      ?string $provider = null
  );
  ```

* The signature of the `\eZ\Publish\API\Repository\Values\ContentType\ContentType::getFieldDefinitions` method was changed to:
  ```php
  abstract public function getFieldDefinitions(): FieldDefinitionCollection;
  ```

## Removed services

* `ezpublish.field_type_collection.factory` has been removed in favor of `eZ\Publish\Core\FieldType\FieldTypeRegistry`

* `ezpublish.persistence.external_storage_registry.factory`

* `ezpublish.config.resolver.core` has been removed. `eZ\Bundle\EzPublishCoreBundle\DependencyInjection\Configuration\ChainConfigResolver` should be used instead

## Changed behavior

* Service based View Matchers now require to be tagged with `ezplatform.view.matcher`. Moreover now to use it you have to prefix service name with `@` sign:
```yaml
site:
    content_view:
        full:
            home:
                template: "content.html.twig"
                match:
                    '@App\Matcher\MyMatcher': ~
```

* Service based SiteAccess Matchers now require to be tagged with `ezplatform.siteaccess.matcher`.

* `eZ\Bundle\EzPublishCoreBundle\Controller` extends `Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\AbstractController` instead of `Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\Controller` which has limited access to the dependency injection container. See https://symfony.com/doc/current/service_container/service_subscribers_locators.html

* SiteAccessAware Repository layer is now used by default. If you need to load repository object in all translations, explicitly pass `\eZ\Publish\API\Repository\Values\Content\Language::ALL` as as prioritized languages list.
