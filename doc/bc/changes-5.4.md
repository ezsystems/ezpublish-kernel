# Backwards compatibility changes

Changes affecting version compatibility with former or future versions.

## Changes

* Stash update brings a slight change to the configuration format.
  Instead of referring to `handlers`, it is now using the term `drivers`.

  ```diff
  stash:
      caches:
          default:
  -           handlers:
  +           drivers:
                  # When using multiple webservers, you must use Memcache or Redis
                  - FileSystem
              inMemory: true
          registerDoctrineAdapter: false
          # On Windows, using FileSystem, to avoid hitting filesystem limitations
          # you need to change the keyHashFunction used to generate cache directories to "crc32"
          # FileSystem
          #    keyHashFunction: crc32
  ```

* Property `id` for `eZ\Publish\Core\FieldType\Image\Value` (value object for `ezimage` FieldType) has changed.
  It wrongly contained the full image path, including the storage directory (e.g. `var/ezdemo_site/storage/images/`.
  To get the full path, use `uri` property.
  Ref: [EZP-23349](https://jira.ez.no/browse/EZP-23349)
  
* `border` image filter configuration has changed. It now takes a 3rd parameter for color (`#000` by default).
  This parameter accepts RGB hexa values. 1st is still border thickness for horizontal, 2nd thickness for vertical.
  
  ```yaml
  ezpublish:
      system:
          my_siteaccess:
              image_variations:
                  my_border_variation:
                      reference: null
                      filters:
                          # Adding a white border, 10px thick.
                          - { name: border, params: [10, 10, "#fff"] }
  ```
  
* `resize` image filter configuration has changed. It now follows the configuration provided in LiipImagineBundle:

  ```yaml
  ezpublish:
      system:
          my_siteaccess:
              image_variations:
                  my_border_variation:
                      reference: null
                      filters:
                          - { name: resize, params: {size: [1080, 1024]} }
  ```

* Language filtering has been changed to respect always available flag, this affects:
  - Criterion\LanguageCode second argument `$matchAlwaysAvailable` changed to true by default
  - ContentService methods with `$useAlwaysAvailable` has been changed to be true by default, affects:
    - loadContentByContentInfo
    - loadContentByVersionInfo
    - loadContent
    - loadContentByRemoteId

  If you have code that expects exception(load) or no content (search) if not a specific language
  exists, you should then review your code and consider setting these properties to false.
  
* HTTP cache is now always purged using a single HTTP request, being emulated (`local`) or real, always using `X-Location-Id` header.
  `X-Group-Location-Id` is not used any more and is thus deprecated.
  
  As a result, semantic setting `ezpublish.http_cache.purge_type` now only accepts `local` or `http` as values.
  `multiple_http` and `single_http` are deprecated and are now considered as `http`. You may change them to use `http`:
  
  ```diff
    ezpublish:
        http_cache:
    -        purge_type: multiple_http
    +        purge_type: http
    ```

* New `DomainTypeMapper` feature causing load and search for Content now returns sub classes of Content
  5.4 introduces a concept of `DomainTypeMapper` and `Custom DomainType` meaning load and search operations
  for content might now return directly User and UserGroup classes.

  How to fix: This can cause problems for you if you have any code type checking on `Core` classes as
  opposed to `API` classes, grep for `eZ\Publish\Core\Repository\Values` in your code to detect these.

* eZ\Publish\API\Repository\Values\User\UserGroup->subGroupCount now returns value `null`
  subGroupCount which was deprecated in 5.3.3 is now disabled as part of refactoring in
  Repository for the new `Custom DomainType` feature.

* Internal function UserGroup->content and User->content no longer works
  As part of `Custom DomainType` feature these domain objects now _are_ Content, as
  opposed to being a decorator for Content. TL;DR: API is exactly the same as before but the
  internals has changed and hence un-documented features like User->content is refactored away.

## Deprecations

* `imagemagick` siteaccess settings are now deprecated. It is mandatory to remove them.
  An exception will be thrown when compiling the container to remind to remove them

  ```diff
  ezpublish:
      system:
          my_siteaccess:
  -            imagemagick:
  -                pre_parameters:
  -                post_parameters:
  ```

* `imagemagick` settings at the application level (`convert` path and filters definitions) have been deprecated.
  They will be removed in v6.0.

* `mimeType` property from BinaryFile is deprecated. The value might not be present for some IO handlers.
  Use `getMimeType` from the IOService instead.

* `IOService::getExternalPath()` and `IOService::getInternalPath()` have been removed.
  `getInternalPath()`, that returned the handler level path, can be obtained using the uri property.

  and by getting the URI from the returned value object.
  `getExternalPath()`, that returns the id seen from the IOService, can be replaced by `IOService::loadBinaryFileByUri()`.
  
* Semantic setting `ezpublish.http_cache.timeout` has been deprecated and is no longer used. It can be safely removed.

  ```diff
  ezpublish:
      http_cache:
  -        timeout: 1
  ```
  
* *Identity definer* services (using `ezpublish.identity_definer` tag) are deprecated in favor of 
  [custom Context Providers from `FOSHttpCacheBundle`](http://foshttpcachebundle.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/configuration/user-context.html#custom-context-providers).
  
  `ezpublish.identity_definer` service tag and related classes/interfaces will be removed in v6.0
  
No further changes are known in this release at the time of writing.
See online on your corresponding eZ Publish version for
updated list of known issues (missing features, breaks and errata).
