# Backwards compatibility changes

Changes affecting version compatibility with former or future versions.

## Changes

* Symfony HTTP Proxy: Internal class `LocationAwareStore` has been renamed to `TagAwareStore`

  To reflect that it now supports multi tagging, and not tied to just locations. This means a few things:
  - Tags are now longer, so make sure to not clear more then about 50 at a time as header limit is 7500 bytes.
  - `X-Location-Id` is still supported internally, but it will be stored in the new disk format.
  - `LOCATION_CACHE_DIR` and `LOCATION_STALE_CACHE_DIR` and related functionality is gone as tags are used instead
  - See `doc/specifications/cache/multi_tagging.md` for further details.

* Extensible Smart cache clearing is currently disabled

  It might come back in form where it generate tags (TBD), and not full lists of all affected location id's like today.

  On Content updates, as specified in `doc/specifications/cache/multi_tagging.md`, the following are now cleared by tags:
  - parent
  - siblings
  - children
  - reverse relations

  This covers what was supported before, but more reliably, BC break here is for custom Smart Cache handlers that did
  custom cache clearing logic _(introduced in eZ Platform 1.x)_. If you use this we are currently looking for feedback
  on use cases this should cover!

## Deprecations

* `X-Location-Id`, is deprecated in favour of `xkey` *(for use both with and without [Varnish xkey VMOD](https://github.com/varnish/varnish-modules/blob/master/docs/xkey.rst))*.


## Removed features

* `X-Group-Location-Id`, was deprecated in 5.4 in favour of just `X-Location-Id`, has been removed.
