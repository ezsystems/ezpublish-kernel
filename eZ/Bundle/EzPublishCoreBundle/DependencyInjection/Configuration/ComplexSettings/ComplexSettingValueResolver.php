/**
 * Factory for complex dynamic settings resolution.
 *
 * Meant to be added, as a service, in place of a complex argument, containing one or more dynamic setting
 * within another string.
 *
 * During the ComplexSettingPass, complex settings will be replaced by a factory based on this class.
 *
 * Each setting is added twice:
 * - once with the $ trimmed, so that we know what is being replaced
 * - once with the $ untrimmed, so that the ConfigResolverPass transforms those into their value.
 *
 * When the services using those factories are built, every dynamic setting in the string
 * is resolved, and the setting is replaced with its value in the string, and returned.
 *
 * Example:
 * ```php
 * $argumentValue = ComplexSettingValueResolver::resolveSetting(
 *     '$var_dir$/$storage_dir$',
 *     'var_dir',
 *     '$var_dir$'
 *     'storage_dir',
 *     '$storage_dir$'
 * );
 * ```
