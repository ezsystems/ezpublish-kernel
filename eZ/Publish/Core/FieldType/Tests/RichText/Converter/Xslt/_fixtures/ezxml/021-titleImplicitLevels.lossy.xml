Conversion data loss explanation:

ezxml does not use explicit level attributes for <header> elements, instead
<header> element levels are indicated through level of nesting inside <section>
elements.

As docbook format uses <section> elements for semantic structuring of the
content, in conversion from ezxml to docbook <section> structure is not
preserved but flattened instead. Heading levels are preserved through explicit
level attributes in docbook format.
