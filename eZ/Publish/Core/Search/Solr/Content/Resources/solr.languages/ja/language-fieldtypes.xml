      <!-- Kuromoji Japanese morphological analyzer/tokenizer (JapaneseTokenizer)

           Kuromoji has a search mode (default) that does segmentation useful for search.  A heuristic
           is used to segment compounds into its parts and the compound itself is kept as synonym.

           Valid values for attribute mode are:
              normal: regular segmentation
              search: segmentation useful for search with synonyms compounds (default)
            extended: same as search mode, but unigrams unknown words (experimental)

           For some applications it might be good to use search mode for indexing and normal mode for
           queries to reduce recall and prevent parts of compounds from being matched and highlighted.
           Use <analyzer type="index"> and <analyzer type="query"> for this and mode normal in query.

           Kuromoji also has a convenient user dictionary feature that allows overriding the statistical
           model with your own entries for segmentation, part-of-speech tags and readings without a need
           to specify weights.  Notice that user dictionaries have not been subject to extensive testing.

           User dictionary attributes are:
                     userDictionary: user dictionary filename
             userDictionaryEncoding: user dictionary encoding (default is UTF-8)

           See lang/userdict_ja.txt for a sample user dictionary file.

           Punctuation characters are discarded by default.  Use discardPunctuation="false" to keep them.
