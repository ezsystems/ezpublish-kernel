# DEPRECATED / NON Functional

This search handler is deprecated, it was an experiment which is limited to just a few features and is stuck on
ElasticSearch 1.4.2 _(very old/outdated version of Elastic, newer versions has several breaks on API hindering
this code from using a newer versions).

A new handler will be added one day for Elastic support, once someone in eZ or community is able to work on that.
