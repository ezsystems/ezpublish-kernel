# eZ Publish 5.x API

This package is a split of the [eZ Publish 5](https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel) public API. It includes
the services interfaces and domain objects from the `eZ\Publish\API` namespace.

It offers a lightweight way to make your project depend on the eZ API and Domain objects, without depending on the
whole ezpublish-kernel.

The repository is read-only, automatically updated from https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel.

Refer to the [main project's README.md](https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/blob/master/Readme.md)
for further information.

## Requiring ezpublish-api in your project
